# Order Summary Card üéµ
# Front-end challenge with HTML and CSS

This is my solution to the Order summary component Front-end mentor's challenge. A perfect project for newbies who are starting to build confidence with layouts!


## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

Ideas to test ourself :

- Write your styles using a pre-processor, such as Sass, Less or Stylus
- Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close to the design as you can

### What I learned

It's my second front-end challenge. I'm trying to use Sass here, to practice what I just learned. I've used a Figma file, try to work on good practices, I also include some Gitmoji in my commits as it's a really useful and fun practice.
